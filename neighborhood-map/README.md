[Live Map](https://meljonk.github.io/neighborhood-map/index.html)

### Project Overview
To develop a single page application featuring a map of a neighborhood that displays map markers identifying at least 
5 locations that you are interested in within this neighborhood. 
This app should display those locations by default when the page is loaded with the highlighted locations, 
third-party data about those locations, and various ways to browse the content, using the Knockout.js framework.
